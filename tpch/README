Some changes have been made to official files provided by TPC-H, to make
them work with TiDB.

## How to use 

Use mysql client log intto `TiDB` and create a databse call `tpch`.
`make tbl` will make `dbgen` and generate `*.tbl` files.

`make load` will create database and tables in TiDB and load all `*.tbl` into TiDB.

After this, please be patient. If you really want to know any progress that `TiDB` is
making right now, you can open another terminal and use query defined in `alltable.count`
to know how many rows in the table.

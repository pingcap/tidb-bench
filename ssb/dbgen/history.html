<li> part-&gt number and supplier-&gt adjusted for 1-based indexing
<li> time-&gt day changed to be day of month, not day of year
<li> t.week changed to be week in year, not day of week
</ul><li><a name="xxx">Changes as of 11/18/92</a><ul>
<li> checked line length and tab for transmission
<li> another chapter in the portability wars. added #include
"machine.h" to dss.h (which is included by everyone else). Any
machine particular porting changes should go here.
<li> fixed fixed-field formats to prevent double printing
<li> expanded PR_FLT formats to %010.2
</ul><li><a name="xxx">Changes as of 10/21/92</a><ul>
<li> added fixed format and column header handling; users of headers
will have to define the header functions to be called in
int (*tdefs.header)()
</ul><li><a name="xxx">Changes as of 10/09/92:</a><ul>
<li> added ansi prototypes and recompiled with gcc -ansi. users may
need to change the CC definition in the makefile and the contents
of CFLAGS to reflect their particular ansi compiler.
<li> replaced all int references with long
<li> replaced all float references with double
<li> found and fixed odate/julian problem TS mentioned in 10/09 phone
call

</ul><li><a name="xxx">Changes as of 9/09/92:</a><ul>
<li> Park/Miller random number generator included
<li> clerk scaling changed to 100 * scale
<li> parts.name always built from 5 selections from colors set
<li> test scaling changed to ~60MB (TEST_SCALING == 10)
<li> logarithmic scaling removed
<li> mfgcost removed and retail/supplier cost bounds adjusted
<li> agg_str memory leak fixed
<li> independent RNG streams on a per column basis
</ul>

This is the revised data generator for DSS.

The rewrite tried to accomplish three things:
<ol>
<li>identify and isolate
all the implicit assumptions about limits, bounds, ranges, distributions, etc.;
<li>standardize the way any given table was generated/
printed to ease understanding and maintenance;
<li>bring the generator
in line with the current work of the committee and the excellent spec
the Indira put together;
<li> provide an easy way to adjust distributions, string contents and to facilitate experimentation to get a
better idea of the impact of data population changes.
</ol><p>

The files included are:<p>
<dl>
<dt>driver.c
<dd>main and the calling routines for the generator
<dt>dist.c
<dd>should really be named dss_util.c; misc routines
<dt>customer.c     <dd> generation and print routines for customer table
<dt>orders.c    <dd>        ""             ""      order table
<dt>parts.c        <dd>            ""             ""      parts/partsupp
<dt>suppliers.c    <dd>            ""             ""      suppliers table
<dt>time.c         <dd>            ""             ""      time table
<dt>customer.h     <dd> associate header files; contain structure
definitions
<dt>dss.h                  <dd>dss.h holds the large number of assumptions and
<dt>orders.h               <dd>values that have been used as IFDEFs.
<dt>parts.h  <dd>
<dt>suppliers.h<dd>
<dt>time.h   <dd>
<dt>dists.dss   <dd> string selections and weights; used to build
distributions

</dl>
<p>
Running make will create an executable (using the compiler flags in
CFLAGS, the ld flags in LDFLAGS and the libraries in LIBS [-O, -s,
and -lm by default]) which will create flat files suitable for dbload.
